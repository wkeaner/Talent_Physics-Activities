      "correctExplanation": "The box doesn't need a force to keep moving — it needs a force to STOP. On ice (friction ≈ 0), there is no horizontal force after you stop pushing, so the velocity cannot change — the box keeps going at the same speed. On sand, friction opposes the motion and gradually reduces velocity to zero. This is Newton's First Law: an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.",
